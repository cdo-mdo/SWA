a) Architectural characteristics of the ticket system

Performance:
- Deadline to make risk report is before 9.am Singapore time.
- The system must support up to 50 concurrent users accessing the risk report.
- The response time for downloading or viewing the report over the internet must not exceed 3 seconds.
- The response time for accessing the report directly on the server must not exceed 1 second.

Scalability:
- The system must be able to cope with trade volumes for the next 5 years.
- The number of trade increase is 10 trades per day. It would be 3650 trades per year.
- Each day, the engine recalculates all counterparties and all trades up to date (e.g., the 5,000 base trades + all new ones).

Security:
- This system must follow bank policy that states system access is restricted to authenticated and authorized users only.
- Reports must only be distributed to authorized users.
- Only a subset of the authorized users are permitted to modify the parameters used in the risk calculations.
- Although desirable, there are no single sign-on requirements.
- All access to the system and reports will be within the confines of the bank’s global network.

Availability:
- System acceptable downtime is less than 30 minutes/day. The availability is 98% 

Adaptability:
- When the new Reference Data System is ready. The Financial Risk System must be configured to work with new system within 3 months. That is the time the legacy system to be decommissionized.

Configurability:
- Input files used in the risk calculation process must be retained for 1 year.

Auditability:
- The following events must be recorded in the system audit logs: 
  – Report generation. 
  – Modification of risk calculation parameters.

Traceability:
- The system should take appropriate steps to recover from an error if possible, but all errors 
should be logged.
- A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap should be sent to the bank’s Central Monitoring Service in the following circumstances:
  - When there is a fatal error with a system component.
  - When reports have not been generated before 9am Singapore time.
